# AutoAstra IDS Backend

This directory contains the Python backend for the AutoAstra vehicle intrusion detection system.

## Files

- `server.py`: Flask server that handles API requests from the frontend
- `ids_engine.py`: The core IDS engine that monitors CAN bus traffic
- `normal2_can.log`: Sample CAN bus log file used for baseline modeling

## Setup Instructions

1. Install Python dependencies:

```bash
pip install flask flask-cors
```

2. Place your `ids_engine.py` and `normal2_can.log` files in this directory.

3. Run the Flask server:

```bash
python server.py
```

4. The server will run on `http://localhost:5000` and will be available for the frontend to connect to.

## API Endpoints

- `POST /start_detection`: Starts the IDS engine
- `POST /stop_detection`: Stops the IDS engine
- `GET /get_alerts`: Retrieves alerts from the log file

## Log File

The IDS engine will create an `ids_alerts.log` file in this directory. This file contains all the alerts generated by the engine.
